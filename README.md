File Processing and Error Handling Challenge
Project Description
This project demonstrates a fundamental skill in programming: file manipulation with robust error handling. The program takes an input file, performs a simple modification (in this case, converting all text to uppercase), and writes the result to a new output file.

A key feature of this program is its ability to gracefully handle common issues, such as a user trying to process a file that doesn't exist.

Features
File Reading: Reads content from a specified input file.

File Writing: Writes the modified content to a new output file.

Content Modification: Converts all text from the input file to uppercase.

Error Handling: Catches and reports FileNotFoundError and other potential exceptions, preventing the program from crashing.

User-Friendly Interface: Prompts the user for filenames and provides clear status messages.

How to Use
Make sure you have a Python environment set up.

Save the code from file_processor.py in your project directory.

Create a sample text file (e.g., input.txt) in the same directory.

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the script:

python file_processor.py

Follow the prompts to enter the name of your input file and the desired name for the new output file.
